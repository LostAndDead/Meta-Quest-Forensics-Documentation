# Analysis Introduction

This is the introduction to the analysis section. Here you will find everything you need to know about analysing the extracted data.

At this point, you should have extracted the data from the Meta Quest 3 using one or all of the methods outlined in the [extraction section](/extraction/intro). If you haven't done this yet, you should go back and do that first else you won't have any data to analyse.

This section is divided into the following sub-sections:

- [Tools](/analysis/tools) - A list of tools that can be used to analyse the extracted data.
- [Artifacts](/analysis/artifacts) - A list of artifacts that can be extracted from the data.

Each of these sub-sections will provide you with the information you need to get started with analysing the extracted data.
If you are looking for specific artifacts, you can use the search bar at the top of the page to find them or check out the master list of artifacts [here](/analysis/artifacts).
