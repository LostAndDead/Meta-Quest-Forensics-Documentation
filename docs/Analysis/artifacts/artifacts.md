## What are Artifacts?

Artifacts are pieces of data that can be extracted from the Meta Quest 3. These artifacts can be used to provide valuable insights into the device usage, user behaviour, and more. By analysing these artifacts, you can gain a better understanding of how the device is being used and what data is being stored on it.

## Restricted Data

It is important to note that this list of artifacts is not exhaustive. The volume of data that can be extracted from the Meta Quest 3 is still heavily restricted as there is no know method to root the device. This means that the data that can be extracted is limited to what can be accessed without root access. As such, this list is not exhaustive and there is not a lot of data that can be extracted from the device at this time. This is a limitation we have to work with until a method to root the device is discovered.

## App Data

When it comes to application specific data please bear in mind that I alone cant install and analysis every app on the Meta Quest 3. This means that the data that can be extracted from the device is limited to the apps that I have installed and used. I encourage you to install and analysis the apps that you are interested in and add them to this documentation. Please see the [contribution guide](/contributing) for more information on how to do this.

## Cloud Data

On the upside, the data that can be extracted from the Meta Cloud is not restricted in the same way. This means that you can extract a lot more data from the Meta Cloud than you can from the device its self. This will lead to the majority of the artifacts in this list being from the Meta Cloud rather than the device its self.
