## Magnet AXIOM

Magnet AXIOM[^axiom] is a digital forensics tool that can be used to analyse the extracted data from the Meta Quest 3. It is a powerful tool that can be used to extract, analyse, and report on the data that has been extracted from the device. It is a commercial tool that is used by law enforcement agencies, government agencies, and corporate security teams to investigate digital crimes and incidents. Its not a tool that is typically used by hobbyists due to its high price tag, but it is a tool that is used by professionals in the industry. While Magnet AXIOM makes extracting the data easier, I personally found it difficult to use when it came to analysing the data.

## Autopsy

Autopsy[^autopsy] is a digital forensics tool that can be used to analyse the extracted data from the Meta Quest 3. It is an open-source tool that is used by all levels of digital forensic examiners. Autopsy does not have the ability to extract data from the device but it can be used to analyse the data that has been extracted using other tools. I found Autopsy to be a lot easier to use than Magnet AXIOM when it came to analysing the data, it was much more user friendly and easier to navigate.

## Andriller

Andriller[^andriller] is a tool used to for a large variety of Android related forensics. Its main use in this project was to extract and explore the ADB Backup file. The CE version of Andriller is free to use and can be downloaded from the Andriller Github.
