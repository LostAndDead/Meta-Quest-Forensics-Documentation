:::warning Legal Consent

This could be in the form of a warrant (in cases of law enforcement) or consent from the device owner. If you do not have the correct permissions to access the device, you could be breaking your local equivalent of the [Computer Misuse Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents) (If outside the United Kingdom).

# Extraction Introduction

This section of the guide will cover the various methods you can use to extract data from a Meta Quest 3. The methods covered in this guide are:
- [MTP](/extraction/mtp)
- [ADB](/extraction/adb/adb_extraction)
- [Cloud](/extraction/cloud)

Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the method you choose will depend on your specific requirements and the data you need to extract. Each of these methods will give different sets of data, if you want to get the most data from the device you will need to use all 3 methods.

## Device Data Modification

If you are wishing to use any data extracted from the device in a court of law, it is important to note that it is not possible to extract data from the device without modifying the data in some way. This is due to all the methods of extraction requiring the device to be unlocked, powered on and the data to be transferred to another device. It is important to keep contemporaneous notes of all actions taken during the extraction process to ensure the integrity of the data is maintained.
