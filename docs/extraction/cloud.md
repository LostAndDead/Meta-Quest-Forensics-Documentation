# Downloading Cloud Export

## What is Cloud Export?

Cloud Export is a feature that allows you to download a copy of all your data from the Meta Cloud. This feature is provided by Meta in accordance with [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) regulations, which require companies to provide users with a way to access and download their data, also known as the right to data portability. The download must include all the data that Meta has collected about you, including your account information, activity logs, and any other data that Meta has stored on its servers.

## How to download your data

:::info
It is important to note that in order to download your data you must log into the Meta account that you wish to download the data from. This will create a entry in the logs that will be included in the download. For this reason you should note the time and IP address you logged in from so you can identify this entry in the logs and exclude it from your analysis.
