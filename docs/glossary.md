# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for terms and concepts used throughout this documentation. If you encounter a term you are unfamiliar with, refer to this glossary for clarification.

## MTP

Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is a protocol used to transfer files between devices. It is commonly used to transfer media files between a computer and a mobile device, such as a smartphone or digital camera. MTP allows the device to be mounted as a storage device on the computer, enabling the user to browse and transfer files using a file manager or media player.

## ADB

Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a command-line tool that allows developers to communicate with an Android device. ADB provides a wide range of functions, including installing and debugging applications, accessing the device shell, and transferring files between the device and the computer. ADB is commonly used by developers, testers, and power users to interact with Android devices[^1].

## Write blocker

A write blocker is a hardware or software tool that prevents data from being written to a storage device. Write blockers are used in digital forensics to ensure that the data on a storage device remains unchanged during the acquisition process. By using a write blocker, investigators can maintain the integrity of the data and ensure that it is admissible in a court of law.

## OBB File

OBB (Opaque Binary Blob) files are used by Android applications to store additional data, such as textures, sounds, and other assets. OBB files are typically used for large applications that require additional resources beyond what can be stored in the APK file. These files are stored in a proprietary format and are encrypted to prevent tampering or unauthorised access.

## Cube Maps

Cube maps are images used to create reflections and lighting effects in 3D applications. Cube maps consist of six images that represent the six faces of a cube, with each face corresponding to a different direction in 3D space. Cube maps are commonly used in virtual reality applications to create realistic lighting and reflections in virtual environments.

## Contemporaneous Notes

Contemporaneous notes are detailed, accurate, and timely records of events, observations, and actions taken during an investigation. Contemporaneous notes are essential in digital forensics to document the acquisition and analysis process, including the tools used, the data examined and any actions taken. Contemporaneous notes provide a clear record of the investigation and can be used to support the findings in court.
