## MTP

Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is a protocol used to transfer files between devices. It is commonly used to transfer media files between a computer and a mobile device, such as a smartphone or digital camera. MTP allows the device to be mounted as a storage device on the computer, enabling the user to browse and transfer files using a file manager or media player.

## ADB

Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a command-line tool that allows developers to communicate with an Android device. ADB provides a wide range of functions, including installing and debugging applications, accessing the device shell, and transferring files between the device and the computer. ADB is commonly used by developers, testers, and power users to interact with Android devices[^1].

## Write blocker

A write blocker is a hardware or software tool that prevents data from being written to a storage device. Write blockers are used in digital forensics to ensure that the data on a storage device remains unchanged during the acquisition process. By using a write blocker, investigators can maintain the integrity of the data and ensure that it is admissible in a court of law.
