# Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the documentation then you can do so by making a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LostAndDead/Meta-Quest-Forensics-Documentation). This will allow you to add new content, fix any errors, or make any other changes you feel are necessary. If you just wish to make quick edits then you can do so by clicking the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of each page, this will take you to the GitHub editor where you can make your changes and submit them as a pull request.
